<h1>About the Project</h1>
<p>This project is a sports event calendar application made with Angular and Bootstrap</p>


<h3>Task 1 – Calendar View</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Implement a calendar view that displays sports events.</li>
    <li><strong>Instructions:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a calendar interface for the current month.</li>
            <li>Display the days of the month in a grid format.</li>
            <li>Indicate days that have scheduled sports events. This can be as simple as a dot or marker on the day.</li>
            <li>(Optional) Show brief information about the events on the calendar (e.g., event name on the day cell).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Task 2 – Event Detail Page</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Provide a way to view full details of a specific event.</li>
        <li><strong>Instructions:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Implement functionality so that when a user clicks on an event marker on the calendar, they are taken to a detail page.</li>
                <li>The detail page should display all relevant information about the event, such as date, time, sport, teams/participants, and any other details you consider important.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Task 3 – Add Event Functionality</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Allow users to add new events during runtime.</li>
        <li><strong>Instructions:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a form where users can input details for a new event (e.g., date, time, sport, teams/participants).</li>
                <li>Implement the functionality to add the new event to the calendar view.</li>
                <li><strong>Note:</strong> It is not required to save the data persistently (e.g., no need to use a database or local storage). The new event can exist only during the current session (runtime).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Task 4 – Responsiveness</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Ensure the site is fully responsive on mobile and tablet devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Instructions:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Use responsive design techniques to make sure the calendar view and all pages adapt to different screen sizes.</li>
                <li>Test your site on various screen widths to ensure usability on mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.</li>
                <li>Pay attention to layout, readability, and touch interactions on smaller screens.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Task 5 – Navigation</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Create a simple navigation system within your application.</li>
        <li><strong>Instructions:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Implement a navigation bar or menu that allows users to switch between the calendar overview and the "Add Event" page.</li>
                <li>Ensure the navigation is accessible from all pages.</li>
                <li>The design can be minimal; focus on functionality.</li>
